# getWeather

getWeather is a an app that retrieves a live weather data from anywhere in the world and displays it in a sleak, easy-to-read weather report. 

## Technologies Used

getWeather is built using vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It also uses Giphy's (API)[https://developers.giphy.com/] to retrieve gifs, and OpenWeather's (API)[https://openweathermap.org/current] for current weather data.

## Highlights


### Weather Reports
[add more info about how we use openweather calls to retrieve data and then what data we parse and why]

### City Search

There are two ways to search for a city in getWeather â€“ using a city name, or a zip code. 

Due to the Open Weather servers existing in multiple places around the world (and even multiple in a given country), it is simple process to find the city most local to you with just name. For example, I live in Concord, California and even though there might be several Concords in the USA, Open Weather retrieves the weather data for the closest Concord to me.

### Backgrounds Gifs
